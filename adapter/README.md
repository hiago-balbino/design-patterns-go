# Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate. A construct that adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

## Motivation

* The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object
