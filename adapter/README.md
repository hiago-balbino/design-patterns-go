# Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate. A construct that adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

## Motivation

* The Adapter acts as a wrapper between two objects. It catches calls for one object and transforms them to format and interface recognizable by the second object

## Notes

* Implementing an Adapter is easy
* Determine the API you have and the API you need
* Create a component that aggregates the adaptee
