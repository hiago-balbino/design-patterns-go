# Design Patterns in Go

This project is aimed at learning and documenting Design Patterns using the Go language.
The knowledge acquited in this project was obtained from [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-go).
Design patterns are not for a specific programming language, they can be used typically for all, but in this project the examples were made using Go. 

*Do not hesitate to get in touch about any doubts.*

## Quickly Notes

The idea about the examples is just to demonstrate how we can use the patterns, so some details were ignored, like unexported/exported structures,  each pattern file has a main function, that collides with others, but you can run using the `go run <folder>/<file>.go command and it will works.
