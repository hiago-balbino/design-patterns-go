# S.O.L.I.D

Look at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) for a better explanation of S.O.L.I.D principles.

This section is not directly related to Design Patterns, but we'll see similarities during example usage.

## The SOLID ideas are

* **The Single-responsibility principle**: There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
* **The Openâ€“closed principle**: Software entities... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* **The Liskov substitution principle**: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
* **The Interface segregation principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
* **The Dependency inversion principle**: Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
